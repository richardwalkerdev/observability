=== Grafana

Grafana is a popular technology used to compose observability dashboards in this case using Prometheus metrics, and later also logs using Loki and promtail.

It's very simple to deploy, and as default it uses a local SQLite database for single instances, the only step necessary to achieve high availability is configure the database settings for any number of Grafana instance to a shared database such as PostgresSQL.

Add the Grafana repository:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/grafana.repo
----

OSS release:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
[grafana]
name=grafana
baseurl=https://packages.grafana.com/oss/rpm
repo_gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key
sslverify=1
sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
----

And install Grafana:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
dnf install grafana -y
----

For a single instance just start the service and go. In this case for a HA pair, update `grafana.ini` with the PostgreSQL database settings, as defined at the start of this page. Search for "database" in the `ini` file and add the following settings:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
vi /etc/grafana/grafana.ini
----

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
type = postgres
host = 192.168.0.70:5432
name = grafana_db
user = grafana
password = changeme
----

Optionally, you can change the http port the service listens on:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
# The http port  to use
http_port = 3000
----

Open firewall:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
firewall-cmd --add-port=3000/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
----


Start and enable Grafana:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable  grafana-server --now
systemctl status grafana-server
----


Grafana will be up and running, for example http://192.168.0.71:3000/. Log in with username `admin` and password `admin`. A password change is mandated on first login.

Repeating the steps on the second node will behave like like the first since there attached to the same database, log in with `admin` and the new password you set during the first install http://192.168.0.72:3000/.

Add the HAProxy load balancer:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
----

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
# Grafana LB
frontend grafana-lb-frontend
    bind 192.168.0.70:3000
    default_backend grafana-lb-backend

backend grafana-lb-backend
    balance roundrobin
    server grafana1 192.168.0.71:3000 check
    server grafana2 192.168.0.72:3000 check
----

And restart HAProxy plus checking the status:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
systemctl restart haproxy
systemctl status haproxy
----

Open firewall on HAProxy host too:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
firewall-cmd --add-port=3000/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
----

==== Load balancers

At this stage there should be four load balancers, all configured using round robin.

The Grafana LB is used for using Grafana itself. The Prometheus and Thanos Query LBs can now be used a data sources in Grafana.

for reference, in this example there are:

* Grafana:       http://192.168.0.70:3000
* Alert Manager: http://192.168.0.70:9093
* Prometheus:    http://192.168.0.70:9090
* Thanos Query:  http://192.168.0.70:10904

==== Data Sources

In Grafana go to Configuration -> Data Sources, and "Add data source", select "Prometheus", under HTTP -> URL add the Thanos Query LB URL http://192.168.0.70:10904

==== Example Dashboard

We have `node_exporter` running a some hosts and included them as scape targets in Prometheus. This is all out-of-the-box configuration. Most common metrics and dashboard have already being solved.

To proved a flavour of the power here, take a look at this dashboard: https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860. (There are lots of others to search for).

In Grafana, use the "+" sign in left hand menu and select "Import", enter the code, in this case "1860" and select "Load", then "Import:

On the next screen, select Prometheus source in the drop down menu, and select "Import":

You should now see some magic happen, the data source provides all the metrics from the node_exporter's picking out the hosts, which are available to select in a drop down menu and using similar Prometheus query's, visualise the data, quite impressive!

Examining pre made dashboard such as this provides the inspiration and know-how for building custom dashboards.

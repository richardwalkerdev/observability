== node_exporter

`node_exporter` is a Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by UNIX and Linux kernels. Think of it as a machine agent that exposes meters at the host level, for things such as CPU, Disk usage and memory etc.

In this guide, there are initially three VMs, utilities, mon1 and mon2, these steps for installing `node_exporter` are repeated on any node required to be monitored.

This high level diagram summarises to architecture. node_exporter is deployed on nodes and the included in the Prometheus scrape targets config. Any number of these node_experter endpoints can be added to monitor infrastructure hosts. In this case, the nodes hosting Prometheus are included. The second Prometheus instance and other nodes are greyed out in the diagram, remember the second instance is a replica of the first.

=== Deploy node_exporter

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
useradd -m -s /bin/false node_exporter
----

Get the latest download link from https://prometheus.io/download/.

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.0.1/node_exporter-1.0.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
----

Extract the archive:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
tar -xvf node_exporter-1.0.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
----

Move into the extracted directory:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
cd node_exporter-1.0.1.linux-amd64
----

Copy the `node_exporter` binary to a suitable path:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
cp node_exporter /usr/local/bin/
----

Create a service for `node_exporter` using `systemd`, example includes a custom port `4100`:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
vi /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
----

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus Node Exporter
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=node_exporter
Group=node_exporter
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter \
    --web.listen-address=:9100

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

Open firewall port:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
firewall-cmd --add-port=9100/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
----

Start and enable the Node Exporter:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable node_exporter --now
systemctl status node_exporter
----


=== Update Targets

Add node_exporter to Prometheus scrape, include labels to identify the services. In this example nodes `mon1 -  192.168.0.71`, `mon2 -  192.168.0.72` and `utilities -  192.168.0.70` are added. Because this config is mounted by any Prometheus instance, the config is the same. This example includes three nodes:

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
vi /etc/prometheus/targets/node_exporter.yml
----

[source%nowrap,yaml]
----
---
- labels:
    service: node_exporter
    env: staging
  targets:
  - 192.168.0.70:9100
  - 192.168.0.71:9100
  - 192.168.0.72:9100
----

Prometheus needs to be restarted on both Prometheus instances:

[source%nowrap,yaml]
----
systemctl restart prometheus
----

At this stage, there are two prometheus targets and three node_exporter targets:
